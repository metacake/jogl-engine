Things to do for Alpha 1:
;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------;
- Separate Game Logic And Engine Logic. We are starting to conflate the two in this project. Maybe a separate project is needed?
- Camera [done]
- Textures
- Wrapper to separate Meshes and transformation [done]
- Model Loader
- Window Resize Hook (this is a Core Change)
- Documentation; cause there is some serious black fucking magic going on in this bitch
